# Color-Game

RGB stands for red green blue . These 3 colours are added together in various ways to reproduce a broad array of colours. The main purpose of the RGB color model is for the sensing, representation and display of images in electronic systems, such as televisions and computers, though it has also been used in conventional photography.

In this project there are 2 levels Easy & Hard . By playing this game we can learn how the color combination works and we can become RGB specialist.
